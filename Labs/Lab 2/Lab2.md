### 2. Why is it important to use a license?
- A software is only open source if other users have the right to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve it. If a license is not provided, then by default the owner has all the rights to the software. It is NOT open source and cannot be modified or used without the owners permission. If a license is not included many developers will not add to the software. This will hinder the growth of a community of developers contributing to the software.

### 3.Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license.
- If a project does not have a license then by default the owner of the software has all the rights. It is not considered to be open source.

### 4. Why the Web beat Gopher
- I agree with the author of this article. Personally I believe that the main reason as to why Gopher failed to beat the web was because the web has much better infrastructure. The technology that Gopher used would be unable to support the web traffic that exists today.

### 5. Android uses Apache license 2.0 and its kernel uses GPL v2
- Google hopes to promote third-party mobile software development and foster a broad developer community on top of Android's Linux-based mobile platform. They chose the  Apache license because it is a permissive license that is conducive to commercial development. Unlike other licenses (GPL), the Apache license also allows for the redistribution of code.
