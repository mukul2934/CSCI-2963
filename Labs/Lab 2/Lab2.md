### 2. Why is it important to use a license?
- A software is only open source if other users have the right to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve it. If a license is not provided, then by default the owner has all the rights to the software. It is NOT open source and cannot be modified or used without the owners permission. If a license is not included many developers will not add to the software. This will hinder the growth of a community of developers contributing to the software.

### 3.Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license.
- If a project does not have a license then by default the owner of the software has all the rights. It is not considered to be open source.

### 4. Why the Web beat Gopher
- I agree with the author of this article. Personally I believe that the main reason as to why Gopher failed to beat the web was because the web has much better infrastructure. The technology that Gopher used would be unable to support the web traffic that exists today.

### 5. Android uses Apache license 2.0 and its kernel uses GPL v2
- Google hopes to promote third-party mobile software development and foster a broad developer community on top of Android's Linux-based mobile platform. They chose the  Apache license because it is a permissive license that is conducive to commercial development. Unlike other licenses (GPL), the Apache license also allows for the redistribution of code.

### 6. Example project: License
- One example project would be to create a micro-service monitor that would allow one to visualize the amount of traffic flowing through each service. The best license to use for this type of project would be an MIT license. It is short and too the point and allows people to do anything they want with the code as long as they provide attribution back to you.


### 7. GPL, LGPL, Apache/BSD
- The Apache license is a lot like the BSD license. It is simple and you are not required to distribute the source code. Additionally you do not have to worry about "infecting" a derived work. The GPL license is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. The LGPL licenses is similar to the GPL license. LGPL allows you to use and distribute the open source software with your application without releasing the source code for your application. The Apache license would be the best for a developer since it is quick and easy. The the GPL license would be the best for the common good because it has no restrictions and is truly open. Lastly the LGPL license would be ideal for a company because it will allow them to use open source libraries in their product without them having to release the products source code.
